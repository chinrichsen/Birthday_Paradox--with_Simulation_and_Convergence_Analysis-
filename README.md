# Birthday_Paradox--with_Simulation_and_Convergence_Analysis-

Birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday. You can read about this problem at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem.

We will perform this problem using simulation, and doing an convergence analysis of the solution
